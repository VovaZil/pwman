	PWMan by Ivan Kelly <ivan@ivankelly.net>
	----------------------------------------

PWMan is a password manager which uses gpg encryption to safeguard your data.
Some code has been taken from Jaakko Heinonen's abook.

COMPILATION

 To compile you must have ncurses installed on you system. You also need libxml.
 Usage relies on Gnu Privacy Guard (gpg) being installed.

INSTALLATION

 Read INSTALL

SETUP

 When you first run pwman, it will prompt you for several things:

* GnuPG ID
   This is the ID of the GnuPG identity that will be used to encrypt the
    password database. You can specify this as your email address, or as
    the 8 (hex) digit key ID
   See http://www.dewinter.com/gnupg_howto/english/GPGMiniHowto.html if you
    are new to GnuPG, and need help importing or creating keys.
* Path to GnuPG
   PWMan needs to call GnuPG, to get it to decrypt and encrypt the password
    database. So, you need to tell PWMan where to find your copy of pgp
* Password Database File
   This is the filename to use for storing your password database in.
* Passphrase Timeout
   PWMan only remembers your GnuPG password for a limted amount of time. After
    this period has elapsed, you will need to re-enter it. This timeout is
    there as a security measure, in case you wander off from your computer
    without logging out.

 These configuration settings will be written to your home directory. You can
 change them at any time by running pwman, and pressing 'o' at any time.

GETTING HELP

 Once pwman is running, and you have entered your (GnuPG) passphrase, you can
 hit '?' to get up the program help. This will tell you what all the keys are
 to perform actions in pwman.
